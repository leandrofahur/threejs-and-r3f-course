# Threejs and R3F Course

## A Few Words
This repository is my personal playground to learn Three.js. 

I'm currently using the oficial vanilla official documentation [here](https://threejs.org/manual/#en).

For the advanced users, I'm navigating through R3F using the official documentation [here](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)

## How to Run The Examples?
There is a [Makefile](./Makefile) with all the appropriate commands for you! You can start by typing:

```bash
$ make help
```

or simply opening the file! The commands will auto generate the run files in the main.js for you file! If you encounter any problems on the renderization, just try to refresh your browser first.
